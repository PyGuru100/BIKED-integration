What you need is a kind of pipeline
for generating machine learning models AND services like this one from the same code.
The same code manipulates the data and trains the model as well as builds the desired
request adapters and controllers and everything. In this specific example:

Raw bikes (XML) --> processing --> standardized data --> split into training and testing sets
--> build model

Raw bike (XML) --> processing --> standardized request --> pass through model
--> return response

Processing and standardization are the key steps here. If the same code is used to both
build the model and adapt user requests, we've got a good system.
